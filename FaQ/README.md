# [![Onix Client Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HugoNotHere/OnixClientFaq/main/onixlogosmall.png)](https://discord.gg/OnixClient) Onix Client FAQ

Onix Client is a legit modification for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Sometimes, you may need help setting it up, and this is what the FAQ is for. This has all of the common questions about Onix Client, installation, and usage. If you have any suggestions for this page, please fork this repository, edit it, and then create a pull request. Finally, if you have any other questions please join the Discord server and create a ticket there. **Note: Before using the client make sure you agree with the Onix Client License which is found at the bottom of this page or [here](https://ocwebsite.github.io/license.html).** 

## üì™ Where can I download Onix Client?

To download Onix Client, go to the [#download](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852334369061863464) channel. Once you do this, you have a few options:

### Launcher (recommended option)
- Download the launcher and open it. Once you click launch, after a few seconds, it will automatically open your game and inject Onix Client.

### Injector & DLL
- Use the Onix Injector and download the DLL. Select the DLL. Then, open Minecraft and go back into the injector. Once Minecraft loads, click Inject.
- You CAN use a third-party injector, but we can't ensure that it will work properly and if it's safe for public use.

## üîí Is Onix Client safe?

Yes, we can assure you that Onix Client is 100% safe for use. Your antivirus might flag it because it injects a DLL into the game. However, due note these things:
- Our injector can only inject into Minecraft, other viruses attack other applications, if not all.
- If you use any third-party program along with our DLL, we are **NOT** ensuring functionality or the fact that this is safe. However, any Onix Client file used is 100% safe.
-  Minecraft is a UWP app, which means it is sandboxed. Meaning even if the DLL was malicious, it wouldn't be able to do very much when injected into the minecraft process. More info about UWP sandboxing [Here](https://labs.sogeti.com/windows-store-apps-live-sandbox).
- If you ever feel like anything is not safe, **DON'T** use it.

## üì± What devices does Onix Client support?

### You have to use Windows 10/11. You also need the 64-bit operating system with an x64-based processor.

This shouldn't be a problem if you have Windows 11, as an x64-based processor is required to use it.

### How do I check?
Right click the Start button and click "System", which takes you to this screen:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/140582244-70a847bf-a2fb-41dc-ae0c-320090bbf23e.png)
- If it says "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you can use Onix Client.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows. We will not be showing you how to do that here, so go do your research.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, ***x86***-based processor", unfortunately, you can't use Onix Client.
- If your PC is ARM or Qualcomm based, you can't use Onix Client either.

### We have no plans to support any devices other than Windows PCs. Don't ask for it.

## üîÑ The launcher didn't auto update. How do I fix this?
Press the Windows Key + R and paste the following:

`cmd.exe /c del "%localappdata%\Onix Launcher\OnixClient.dll" && pause`

This will delete the old Onix Client dll, and the launcher will install the new one on launch.

## üåä When I open the client, I get an error saying: "You are attempting to open a file of type 'system file'". Why does this happen?

This is because you are trying to open the DLL, which only works with other injectors. The DLL file cannot be opened and is not meant to be either. If you want to use this method please check out the Onix injector. If you use a third-party injector, we are not responsible for anything that might happen.

## üîß Can I turn off or customize the "OnixClient on top!" splash text?

No. We use this to make diagnosing problems much easier for our support team.

## üêû When I inject, my game crashes. Why does this happen?

Your game is most likely on an unsupported version. If you are below 1.16.40, you will need to upgrade to a higher version. If you are above the latest supported version, you will need to downgrade. You can downgrade (or upgrade) using [MCLauncher](https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher).

### List of supported versions:
```
(1.19)     (1.18)     (1.17)     (1.16)
1.19       1.18.0     1.17.0     1.16.40
1.19.0     1.18.1     1.17.2     1.16.100 (partial)
1.19.2     1.18.2     1.17.10    1.16.200
1.19.10    1.18.10    1.17.11    1.16.201

## ‚ùóÔ∏è When trying to change version with McLauncher, it gives me an error saying "The Temporary directory for backing up MC data already exists." How do I fix this?
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/832745413916360806/969980565468086342/Screenshot_30_04_2022_16_16_11.png?width=800&height=400)

Press Windows key + R and paste %localappdata%\ and find a folder called TmpMinecraftLocalState, then right click on the folder and click on "Cut". Next go to your desktop and click paste. Now open mcLauncher again and launch a version. Don't worry if your settings and packs are gone because you have them backed up on the folder you moved to your desktop. Next replace all the files in the folder on your desktop with the files in %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\localstate\ and you're done! If this didn't work, you can join the discord and ask for help from the coummunity!

## üß• Why does it say "as nobody (HOW)" on Discord instead of my Gamertag?

Make sure you have the Xbox Console Companion, which you can download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-console-companion/9wzdncrfjbd8#activetab=pivot:overviewtab). Log in, and it should show up after restarting the launcher.

If you have already downloaded Xbox Console Companion, log out and log back in to fix it.

## ‚ùì I clicked Launch and I see the "OnixClient on top!" splash text. Now what?

Go to a world or server and press L or Insert, then you'll be able to see the Client Settings button. To activate modules, right-click on them.

## Common launcher errors

### üè¢ Architecture Error

You have a 32-bit version of Minecraft. This is usually branded under FPS Boosting or Lag-Free AppX files. These are not compatible with Onix Client.

### ‚õî Unsupported Version
![Unsupported Version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139366307-d319f1ea-36c3-4978-b8ba-ad3cd891141e.png)

You have a version of Minecraft that is not supported. You can see this list of supported versions [here](https://github.com/HugoNotHere/OnixClientFaq#list-of-supported-versions).

### üíâ Injection Error
![Injection Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139366443-21a01000-36c3-44a0-842e-30030bdf31d5.png)

An error occurred while trying to inject Onix Client. This may be due to your antivirus, however, we cannot quite pinpoint this issue to a cause. Please open a ticket if you have issues resolving this problem.

## üé® How can I get Onix UI?

It's being remade as of recently. You'll have to wait.

## üí∞ How can I support Onix and the client?

## üåà Why are my rainbow modules not synced/in time with each other?

Press L, click on Client Settings, then turn on "Sync All Rainbow" on the Global Settings. This should sync the modules together.

## üîé Why is the zoom not working with my hotkey?

Right-click the module first (you can do this with any module to enable it). This is not a bug, but a feature that allows Onix to have a zoom out animation if you have zoom animations enabled.

## ‚ùå How do I remove the client?

Restart your game. You can no longer uninject while in game.

## üí∫ What's the latest version of the client?

## üß™ Why don't the PotionHUD icons show up?

One of your texture packs probably broke them. But don't worry, we have a PotionHUD Fixer [here](https://github.com/HugoNotHere/OnixClientFaq/blob/main/files/PotionFix.mcpack?raw=true)! Due note: this pack may break custom hotbars/XP bars.

Turn off "Hide Tile Entities".

## üñåÔ∏è How do I change the theme of my Onix GUI?

Say .theme in chat.

## üíú How do I reset a colour/module?

Middle-click the change colour button or the module in the Onix GUI. You can middle-click by pressing the scroll wheel down or clicking with 3 fingers on a trackpad.

## üîª How do I remove the red arrow from Minecraft?

Download [this pack](http://www.mediafire.com/file/kqyjo9s9ld39nkn/No+Red+Arrow+by+Mhavin.mcpack/file) and apply it. The reason why it exists is that the pack maker/porter of one of your packs never updated hud_screen.json. The bug report and discussion can be found [here](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105882).

~~Avira users:~~
~~Avira will not let you use Onix Client, even if it's disabled. We recommend you uninstall Avira until we get this issue sorted out with them.~~

^^ This issue is now fixed.


If you have an antivirus that's not included here or if a link stops working, you can DM [@ItzHugo#2308](https://discord.com/users/731013984710426694) or [@Isaiahluke40#3089](https://discord.com/users/397244496586211339) so we can fix it.

If both of us are not online, we suggest going to [#make-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/945717582269399050) and create a ticket. (Please wait patiently after making a ticket)
